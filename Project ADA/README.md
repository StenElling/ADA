# Title
Zurich on the move
# Abstract
With an overall population of 415,682 (2016) theCity of Zurich is Switzerland’s largest city. Zurichis home to a strong international banking and fi-nance  sector  as  well  as  major  Swiss  and  inter-national corporation.  Zurich has been repeatedlylisted  amongst  the  most  attractive  and  ’livable’cities in the world. As a result Zurich attracts peo-ple from within Switzerland and around the world.The city Zurich is divided into 34 statistical dis-tricts (Stadtquartier) that are grouped into 12 bor-oughs (Kreis).  The district sizes vary from 650 to32,000 residents.Statistical   overviews   for   overall   populationsizes, ratio of foreigners etc.  are easily availableon Wikipedia, see (Subdivisions of Zurich, 2017),or  more  detailed  overviews  are  provided  by  theCity of Zurich, see (Kreise  Quartiere, 2017). Our  project  focus  on  using  the  subdivision  ofthe data into age, gender and marital status to an-alyze individual subgroups such as young profes-sionals or families.   Moreover,  we are interestedin changes in the population and movement dataover time and seeks to identify which districts at-tract some groups of people more than others.

# Research questions
1) Where do people move from/to or within the city of Zurich? 
2) Are there patterns in these movements and do the differ according to age, gender, civil status, nationality, income? 
3) Do these patterns change over the years, in particular did the financial crisis have a noticeable impact?
4) Are moving patterns correlated to the availability of local amenities like the number of schools, access to public transport, supermarkets etc? 
5) How can our results be used for city planning?


# Dataset
For  our  project  we  used  data  sets  on  popula-tion movements available on ”Open Data Z ̈urich”(https://data.stadt-zuerich.ch/dataset).   Three datasets  captured  the  number  of  people  moving  toZurich from outside (Set 1), people moving withinZurich (Set 2), and people leaving Zurich (Set 3).The data in these data sets is subdivided by year(1993-2016), districts (to or from which a movedtook place), age groups (10 year bins), gender andmarital  status  (Single,  Married,  Divorced,  Wid-owed). For Set 1 and Set 3 detailed data on the ori-gin respectively destination of the people is avail-able but was not used.We  compared  this  data  against  the  populationdata  for  Zurich  (Set  4),  which  is  subdivided  byyear, district, age and gender.The  original  data  was  given  in  German.   Wetranslated  the  column  names  and  the  descrip-tors   of   the   main   features   like   marital   status,Swiss/Foreign  to  English.    Geographical  nameswere not translated. Throughout this report we re-fer to the 34 Stadtquartiere as districts, while big-ger units are referred to as Kreis.
